# Bouncing Ball Simulation

## Description
This is a very simple Python program, I am just messing around with the pygame library a bit. I'm sure you've seen those videos online before videos that get your attention. This just simulates balls bouncing within a player-controlled circle. The player can move the circle around the screen, and new balls can be spawned inside it. Balls are trapped within the circle and bounce off its edges.

## Features
- **Player-Controlled Circle**: Use standard "WASD" controls to move white circle around screen.
- **Bouncing Balls**: Balls are confined within the circle and bounce off its boundaries.
- **Dynamic Ball Spawning**: Press the spacebar to spawn new balls inside the circle.

## Controls
- **W/A/S/D**: Move the player-controlled circle up, left, down, and right.
- **Spacebar**: Spawn a new ball inside the circle.
- **Q**: Quit the simulation.
